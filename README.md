# Suffix Array Zoo

This repo contains multiple implementation of suffix array construction algorithms, including internal and external memory methods.

## TODO
- [ ] Investigate Prefix Doubling Algorithms, Karp, Miller & Rosenburg (1972)
- [ ] Investigate Recursive Algorithms, Farach (1997)
- [ ] Investigate Induced Copying Algorithms, Puglisi, Smyth & Turpin (2007)
- [ ] QSufSort (based on 1999 Larsson-Sadakane algorithm)
- [ ] Yuta Mori's DivSufSort "fastest known suffix algo in main memory" as of 2017
- [ ] Ilya Grebnov's even faster implementation 
- [ ] Look at google research's SA-IS extern memory implementation
